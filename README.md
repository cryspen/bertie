Bertie is a minimal, high-assurance implementation of TLS 1.3 written in a subset of Rust called [hacspec].

It is built upon the following design principles:

1) **Purely functional**: no mutable data structures or externally visible side-effects.
2) **Verification friendly**: written in hacspec and translates to [F*].
3) **Succinct and minimal**: configured with a single protocol version and cipher suite.

Karthikeyan Bhargavan first authored Bertie at Inria in 2021 and transferred it to [Cryspen] in 2022.
It is licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) but not yet ready for public consumption.

### USING BERTIE

An example HTTPS client using Bertie is provided in the `simple_https_client` crate.
The client retrieves a web page using Bertie as the underlying TLS implementation.

You can try it out by executing ...

```bash
$ cd simple_https_client
$ cargo run -- example.com
```

There is also a HTTPS server available as `simple_https_server`.

*WARNING*: Do not use in production. This is an early draft of Bertie and strictly work-in-progress.

Before contributing, please have a look at the [contributing guidelines] and the [code of conduct].

#### PROJECT STRUCTURE

* `.github` contains the configuration for GitHub Actions CI.
* `assets` contains non-code files that are used in the Bertie project. (Only logo for now.)
* `bogo_shim` contains the BoGo shim application that is used for testing against BoringSSL's test runner.
* `record` is a crate that provides common functionality used in `simple_https_client` and `simple_https_server`.
* `simple_https_client` is an example crate that implements a Bertie HTTPS client.
* `simple_https_server` is an example crate that implements a Bertie HTTPS server.
* `src` contains the Bertie source code (that must be valid according to hacspec.)
* `tests` contains all tests.
