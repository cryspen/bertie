This directory holds the extracted F* code for the Bertie protocol layer.

The `extraction` folder is generated by running `hax-driver.py extract-fstar`

We then apply a patch to this folder for lax checking to obtain `extraction-lax`.

This patch mainly performs the following fixes which will become unnecessary with future hax fixes:

* Recursive functions are not produced with `let rec` in F*
* IndexMut implementations need to implemented by hand in F*
* Empty lists need type annotations in F*

Finally, we edit the code in `extraction-lax` by hand to obtain panic-freedom proofs in `extraction-panic-free`.
Eventually these hand-edits will be backported into Rust as pre- and post-conditions.
